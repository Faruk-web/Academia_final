                        <p>The Temporary Graduate Visa (Subclass 485) in Australia is a popular visa option for international
                            students who have completed their studies in Australia and wish to gain valuable work experience in the
                            country. This visa is designed to allow recent graduates to work, live, and potentially settle in Australia
                            temporarily after completing their studies. It is an excellent opportunity for those looking to gain
                            practical experience and potentially qualify for permanent residency in Australia. <br>Here are some key aspects of the Temporary Graduate Visa (Subclass 485):</p>
