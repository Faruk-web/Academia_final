                            courses, allowing students to explore their interests and passions. This diversity
                            enables students to tailor their education to align with their career goals and personal
                            interests. For instance, one can pursue a degree in Engineering while also studying
                            Music, creating a unique educational experience that might not be readily available in
                            their home country.</p>

                            fluently enhances your communication skills and fluency. Bilingualism or
